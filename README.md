Testing our api's to create a discord bot.
"Was trying to learn python"
keep_alive connects to uptime robot which I used to host the bot on and pings it at regular intervals to keep it alive.
weather.py manages the warcher functions.
in main.py enter giphy and open weather api from their wbsites.
